Well hello there

I am sorry to report to you, dear reader, that the majority of the scripts (if not all of them) in this repo *may be* broken af
-- As of this lineupdate, actually, I think most of them almost work!
They are broken for many different reasons. Most commonly this means I decided the script will not make me money.
Money isn't everything, of course-- many projects here may have simply lost my attention span, but changing the world is much, much, much easier if a person can buy food of their choosing.
Anyway, these scripts are all things which I may come back to or need for a future headstart on a project.
I will endeavor for future me to be more descriptive of the intention of the code, and to be more organized with the scripts. For now, though, they are just here. Make sense of them as you see fit.

may death come swiftly to us all,
nips
