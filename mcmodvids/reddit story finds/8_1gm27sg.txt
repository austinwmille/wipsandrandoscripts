If you've ever used a phone by a Chinese company, you'll note they have a tendency to run like crap, filter your photos, and sell your data (so does Google) so naturally, I wanted to install a custom rom. Sure, that's the first solution you think of. It went so well. Bootloader unlocked all at my own risk, and then I try to flash the rom. Not enough space, after some research I found I could delete the "product" partition at my own risk. Having not specified a or b, I thought nothing of it. Half way through going to boot TWRP, it decides to reboot. Having deleted userdata, adb debugging came pre-disabled. It now continuously vibrates and reboots shaming me for killing it. Its only input to the outside world is displaying "Redmi" over and over, and I have no way into it.

Â£200 mistake. Not my worst work.

TL;DR buy a Google Pixel

Edit: no need to downvote everything, I know I'm an idiot that's why anyone posts here.

Edit again: Fastboot nope. Recovery nope.

Also edit: Get it in your head, I cannot splurge on a phone all at once. It has to be pay monthly or nothing. Ergo debating dumbphone

Edit: Redmi Note 10 5G

Edit: MTK Client is the solution to all my problems. Today I Un-f\*\*\*ed Up.
