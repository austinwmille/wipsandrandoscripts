Ok so to start, me and my gf have a 6 year old border collie who's extremely clingy. He doesn't like being outside the room without us and claws on the door to let us in and even barks.


Obviously this causes issues with things, such as sex. He's a little cock blocker... There were a couple nights where me and my gf were getting very intimate and either had him decide he wants in and scratch the door, or we realize he's in the room and it ofc kills the mood

So there's a few times lately I have given him frozen dog food in a toy for him to lick which keeps him busy 

At first it worked so good, he'd not barge through the door and stay downstairs even when hrbfknidhed... But then recently he  did try to come back a second time, interrupting the sex... And I made the mistake of giving him more food. And then the same thing a few nights ago.


Now he's expecting food and drooling as soon as he sees or hears us getting intimate. He is so smart and can totally tell we're bribing him and pushing our limits

Wat do?

Tldr I gave my dog food to leave me and my gf alone during sex and now he expects food each time he notices us intimate
