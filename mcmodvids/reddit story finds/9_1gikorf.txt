Working cross border and getting my salary in another country and currency than were I Iive, I’ve always tried very hard to have an account intended for my bills. It should always contain about the same amount going out every month. Thus ensuring I can pay them even if my salary has not yet been transferred over. 

Well. This summer I also got two very cute cats. And I’ve been buying (probably too many) things for them. So my bills account has been lower than normal, as I’ve not been paying everything directly with my card. 

Today I checked my account to make sure everything is payed and that the balance is where it should be. Couldn’t figure why it was so low. 

As the accounts is for almost only bills, I can get a monthly overview pretty fast when I look it over. I notice this one monthly expense being double booked. On nooo, I must have processed it twice. One of the larger ones too covering both parking and the fee to the owners association in my building. Make a search. Notice I did the same thing last month. 

Time to call them I guess. And figure out if they’ll repay me, or if I just don’t have to pay for parking and the fee to the owners association in the building I live in. 

Almost $500 a month. 🤦🏼‍♀️

TL;DR : messed up paying my bills, and overpayed by almost $1.000 over 2 months. I just thought I’d bought waaaay too many things for my new cats. Because they’re worth it. 😻
