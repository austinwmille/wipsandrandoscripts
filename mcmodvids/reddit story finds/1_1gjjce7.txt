A small one, but I found it funny. My dog and constant companion for the last 14 years passed away recently. I decided to clean up and threw out a bunch of her stuff. Including her dog bed and way too many toys. Including several very loud squeaky toys.

The trash pickup is bright and early this morning. Happened to be while I was looking out the window and making my morning coffee. The sanitation worker dumped the bags into the truck then immediately hit the lever to compact the garbage. 

As I mentioned it was early morning, and there were several startlingly loud toys, which scream out when squeezed. Yes the worker definitely heard the noise, and stopped the compactor from any further movement. I'm glad to report that emergency services were not notified about living things being thrown away and crushed.

TL;DR as required. TIFU by throwing a bunch of squeaky toys in the garbage.
