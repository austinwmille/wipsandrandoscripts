I suppose technically yesterday,  but I called the VA patient to request a different provider, due to a lack of comfort being seen by a male doctor. Today, he himself calls me, directly asks me about calling the patient advocate, and the *graciously* tells me I can be reassigned to another provider. 


All this was after I asked him to get me a referral to the breast clinic. Had a biopsy in September (its benign), but after the biopsy healed I began having extreme sensitivity away from the biopsy site. The ER found nothing, and he wanted me to come in for an office visit that I didn't think was medically necessary. Which it must not have been, as he immediately put in the referral when I pushed back. 


Tl:dr - Didn't think I'd have to ask the patient advocate to maybe not tell the doctor I was complaining about, that I was complaining about him.
