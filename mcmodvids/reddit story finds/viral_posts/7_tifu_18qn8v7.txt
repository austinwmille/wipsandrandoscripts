I don’t really think this is a huge deal but all of the older people in my family are freaking out at me. I was in charge of cooking the Christmas turkey for the first time this year so I got up early, seasoned it, and put it in the oven. I’ve been basting every hour or so and I just pulled it out of the oven. Then my mom and grandma started freaking out because I cooked the turkey breast side down. I genuinely didn’t know that there was a right side up for cooking a turkey. It is thoroughly cooked and it’s not burnt or anything but they are acting like I ruined Christmas. Now they are saying that they can’t trust me to do anything and I’m completely incompetent. They are trying to figure out where to get a turkey in a hurry since this one is ruined. I was in the middle of baking a cake but now I’ve been ejected from the kitchen until it is time for me to do the dishes (usually the people who cook the meal don’t have to do dishes in my family).

TLDR: I cooked the turkey upside down and now I’m banned from the kitchen

Update: The guys of the house and I ate the turkey and it was genuinely the best turkey I ever had! The ladies sat there glaring the whole meal and refused to touch anything I made. I helped with dishes just to keep the peace since I’m home from college for another almost 2 weeks. Many lessons were learned today and I am probably going to cook the turkey upside down for the rest of my life!
