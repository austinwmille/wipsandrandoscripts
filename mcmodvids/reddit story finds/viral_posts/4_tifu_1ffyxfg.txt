I bought this random item in a flee market in Berlin because it looked cool and it was cheap. It’s been in my wardrobe ever since until I took it out yesterday to take photos of it because I found out about the r/whatisthisthing page. Lots of people came back with different answers but a few people said it looked like it was radioactive and that I should go to my local fire station to check it. This morning I phoned the non-emergency fire brigade number and explained the situation. Two minutes later 3 fire engines arrive to test the object which was in fact radioactive. They then called for backup and 3 ambulances 3 police cars and a counterterrorism CBRN bomb disposal unit arrive. They evacuate all the flats in the building and after 4 hours they finally remove the object. It turned out to be Thorium (I’m not sure about the isotope number or radiation levels)

TL;DR Object I bought in a flee market is identified as radioactive thanks to Reddit and fire brigade
