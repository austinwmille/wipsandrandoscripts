My roommate only likes Japanese girls. He has never met a Japanese person in his life, everything he knows he's learned from anime. He has shown me his dating profiles on mixerdates which I thought was straight up delusional. But since I didn’t wanna have an uncomfortable conversation with him and was certain he wouldn’t hit, I didn’t bring it up.

But recently he actually brought a girl over who looked decent and really cute. An actual real-life Japanese girl. She swings by for his date and I’m trying so hard to contain myself and want to high-five him so bad. Anyhow he goes out with her and turns out she got really weirded out by him cos he kept bringing up these anime references thinking she would get it and reciprocate. I don’t know what to say, except I knew it would happen. 

He’s a really nice guy, just that he needs to drop the Japanese girl anime pedestal thing and be more normal. So i sit him down, and start telling him how it’s super weird to real females and how they aren’t like that and how if he gets out of this mentality, it would definitely improve his chances.. He starts crying and doesnt want to talk to me anymore, he is also moving out next week. I lost a friend and someone to help pay the rent.

TL;DR: Don't try and get someone out of their fantasy place, regardless of what good you think you are doing for them.
