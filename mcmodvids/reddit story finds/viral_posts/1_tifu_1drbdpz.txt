So I was at the mall with my son, whose a toddler. Anyway my son was playing really well with this little girl.

Like they where two peas in a pod playing together, just having a blast.

I'm a big dude, Lotta people say I look scary type look.

Anyway my son is playing, I'm eatting my lunch and I decide I need to figure out who this girls parents are.

I figure it out, she's apparently a hot mom.

So I walk up and go "Hey our kids are playing together, maybe I can get your number and we can setup a play date" she looks at me and goes "um, married" I was thinking that's nice, my son wants to play with your daughter so I said 

"Me too, my wife would love to meet you, our kids are playing well together, do you wanna set up a play date"

At that point her husband walls up and she goes "this guy is asking for my number after I told I'm married"

At this point I'm thinking fuck it, not worth it. I apologize and sit down and wait for my son to finish playing.

Tl:Dr son was playing with a little girl, tried to get the girls parents info so we could setup a play date. Her mom thought I was trying to pick her up.
