Tonight I was playing GTA V in the basement and my wife caught me having sex with one of the prostitutes in game. 

If you didn't know, GTA allows players to pick up hookers in your car and pay them for various sexual services. I had headphones on and thought my wife was asleep. She ended up being behind me in the back of the room and basically saw the entire shooting match. 

My wife is very religious/conservative and I think I may have really fucked up. We do share a lot of the same values but I have been doing this in GTA since before we met. I tried to explain that it was just a game but in her eyes it was betraying her trust. 

She is even more pissed because I went back for seconds and thirds, paying the prostitute multiple times. 

I am no longer welcome in by bed and this could actually cause a major problem for us. She is the type of woman who gets jealous when attractive women are in shows or movies we are watching. 

TL;DR 

I was unfaithful to my wife in a video game and now my marriage may be over.
