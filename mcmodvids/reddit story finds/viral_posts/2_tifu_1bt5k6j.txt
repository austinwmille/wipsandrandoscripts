Title covers it, thought I was on mute and was not. Someone was messaging me on the side asking if I could meet at certain times (my very limited free time is on my calendar). I yell in pure frustration "Jesus Christ, check my fucking calendar!" The meeting got really quiet and I realized what happened. Just gave a little sheepish "my bad, thought I was muted" and went silent. The person I was yelling about messaged me on the side and apologized, which made me feel even worse.

I apologized, and said it was very unprofessional. I tried to explain how I am really stressed with deadlines (I am) and was venting but I still feel like a total ass, which is accurate. This was a smaller group of decent people so I don't think anyone will complain to my boss or anything like that, I just get to live with my embarrassing FU.

TL;DR: Yelled at/about people in an online meeting thinking I was muted.  


edit: grammar
