So this just happened a few minutes ago, said boyfriend is still next to me. 

A bit of context, my partner lost his smell for the most part due to long Covid. Another piece of context, I’m lactose intolerant. That doesn’t stop me tho.

So for dinner last night, I ate. A lot more dairy than i probably should have (baked potato with hella cheese and even more sour cream), so today my stomach was a bit fucked up. To say the least.

I was in the car with my bf, on our way to pick up lunch, and my stomach was starting to hurt so I decided to let a couple “Silent but Deadly” rips out. Opened the window a bit so it wouldn’t be as bad, but it only did so much.

After a few seconds, my partner starts panicking and pulls over onto the side of the highway. He started frantically checking the car, and I’m pretty clueless when it comes to cars so I asked him what was wrong with the car

He explained to me that he smelled rotten eggs, which is a sign that the battery is failing. I just looked at him and said “…babe, Jeremy (the car’s name) is fine. I just ripped ass.”

We ended up not being able to leave for another 10 minutes because he couldn’t stop laughing, but he now has me as “🚗💨failing car battery🚗💨” in his phone. 


TLDR; farted in the car and made my bf think it was breaking down
