Working cross border and getting my salary in another country and currency than were I Iive, I’ve always tried very hard to have an account intended for my bills

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It should always contain about the same amount going out every month

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Thus ensuring I can pay them even if my salary has not yet been transferred over

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This summer I also got two very cute cats

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And I’ve been buying (probably too many) things for them

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So my bills account has been lower than normal, as I’ve not been paying everything directly with my card

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Today I checked my account to make sure everything is payed and that the balance is where it should be

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Couldn’t figure why it was so low

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As the accounts is for almost only bills, I can get a monthly overview pretty fast when I look it over

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I notice this one monthly expense being double booked

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
On nooo, I must have processed it twice

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
One of the larger ones too covering both parking and the fee to the owners association in my building

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Make a search

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Notice I did the same thing last month

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Time to call them I guess

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And figure out if they’ll repay me, or if I just don’t have to pay for parking and the fee to the owners association in the building I live in

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Almost $500 a month

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
🤦🏼‍♀️

TL;DR : messed up paying my bills, and overpayed by almost $1.000 over 2 months

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I just thought I’d bought waaaay too many things for my new cats

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Because they’re worth it

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
😻
