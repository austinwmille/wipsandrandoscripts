Okay first thing to know about me is that I am socially a dumbass

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I cannot for the life of me function in social interactions

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I’m terrible at talking to people and idk, I always just seem to drown with anything social.

I also would like to make it known that for whatever reason, lately I have been extremely motion sensitive

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Meaning that out of the blue riding in the back seat of a car feels like being on a roller coaster for me

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Okay, so today I hire an Uber to run me up to the post office

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Simple

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
For any one but me :(
Right off the bat the car starts moving and I feel that horrible feeling of my stomach dropping

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I panic, I don’t know what to do and unconsciously I end up making whimpers of pain noises

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And as I do this I’m pretty sure my driver thinks I’m insane because when she slows down or stop I’m completely fine and stop doing it

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And then what do I do? Instead of doing the sensible thing and explaining that I am car sick, can you please slow down no! Forget reason and logic

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How stupid that I would even dare to think that! No, what I do instead is apologize and then say I’m getting over a cold

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Am embarrassed? Yes

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Am I feeling stupid? 100%
I think above all though I just feel sad that something as simple as my errand can wind up being a complete disaster when it should just be so easy.

TL;DR: I can’t handle motion anymore and when I tried to go to the post office I ended up making whimpering pain noises.
