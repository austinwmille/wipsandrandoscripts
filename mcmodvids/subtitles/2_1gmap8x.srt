This one is fairly straightforward

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yesterday, while at Goodwill, my wife unexpectedly put a hat on my head

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
As a hypochondriac, this made me quite nervous

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This morning, I woke up with an itchy head, so convinced I had lice that I didn’t bother checking

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I gathered every hat and hoodie in the house, washing them in hot water

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Once they were done, I went to the store and spent $100 on a lice treatment, new sheets, pillowcases, comforter, and more

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Upon returning home, I started treating myself for lice

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
After letting the special shampoo sit in my hair for a bit longer than necessary, being extremely careful when washing it out, and meticulously combing through my hair with a fine-toothed comb, I spent over an hour of my time

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Anyway I’ve come to the conclusion that I didn’t have lice.

TL;DR- I spent $100 and my whole day treating myself for lice that I didn’t have
