A small one, but I found it funny

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My dog and constant companion for the last 14 years passed away recently

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I decided to clean up and threw out a bunch of her stuff

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Including her dog bed and way too many toys

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Including several very loud squeaky toys.

The trash pickup is bright and early this morning

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Happened to be while I was looking out the window and making my morning coffee

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The sanitation worker dumped the bags into the truck then immediately hit the lever to compact the garbage

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
As I mentioned it was early morning, and there were several startlingly loud toys, which scream out when squeezed

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes the worker definitely heard the noise, and stopped the compactor from any further movement

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm glad to report that emergency services were not notified about living things being thrown away and crushed.

TL;DR as required

TIFU by throwing a bunch of squeaky toys in the garbage.
