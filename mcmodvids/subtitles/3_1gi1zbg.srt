This happened yesterday, but I needed a day to recover.

I’m a tech executive at a midsize company

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I have a new team member—a younger female who is sharp, talented and professional

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
She just started, so we haven’t gotten to know each other very well

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
She was in my office for a meeting

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I was at my desk wrapping something up, and she was sitting at the small meeting desk in my office, working on something while she waited

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
She wasn’t looking at me.

I finished and sent an email, then turned to join her at the desk

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
As I did, I pressed my hands together as if to indicate “ok, on to the next thing.”

Out of my hands comes the beefiest fart noise you can imagine

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It literally startled me

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
She didn’t flinch, but there was definitely a shift in the room.

I didn’t know what to do

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I wasn’t 100% sure she heard it, so it seemed weird to bring it up

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I even tried squeezing my hands together a couple more times to make it happen again, but no such luck

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now I might always be the boss who blasted ass all over the office.

tl;dr: My hands farted and ruined my professional credibility
