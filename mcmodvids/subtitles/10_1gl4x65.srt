So this just happened a few minutes ago, said boyfriend is still next to me

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A bit of context, my partner lost his smell for the most part due to long Covid

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Another piece of context, I’m lactose intolerant

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That doesn’t stop me tho.

So for dinner last night, I ate

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A lot more dairy than i probably should have (baked potato with hella cheese and even more sour cream), so today my stomach was a bit fucked up

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
To say the least.

I was in the car with my bf, on our way to pick up lunch, and my stomach was starting to hurt so I decided to let a couple “Silent but Deadly” rips out

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Opened the window a bit so it wouldn’t be as bad, but it only did so much.

After a few seconds, my partner starts panicking and pulls over onto the side of the highway

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He started frantically checking the car, and I’m pretty clueless when it comes to cars so I asked him what was wrong with the car

He explained to me that he smelled rotten eggs, which is a sign that the battery is failing

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I just looked at him and said “…babe, Jeremy (the car’s name) is fine

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I just ripped ass.”

We ended up not being able to leave for another 10 minutes because he couldn’t stop laughing, but he now has me as “🚗💨failing car battery🚗💨” in his phone

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
TLDR; farted in the car and made my bf think it was breaking down
