TIFU by giving my ex a nickname on FB messenger, not realizing they would be able to see it..

So, my ex "borrowed" a lot of money from me

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A LOT

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My entire life savings, and then put me into debt by being emotionally manipulative

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
When I asked about repayment, he had all the excuses and threatened  to just claim bankruptcy so he wouldn't have to pay.

The last contact we had, he basically said, do whatever you want because I don't have anything and there's nothing you can do about it.

I've been keeping track of everything

I recently archived our FB message history because I was tired of seeing it evey time I opened messenger.

Tonight, I was playing around with settings and saw that you can set a nickname.

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I changed his nickname to "thief", only to see moments later that it showed in the chat...! ðŸ˜³ 

I quickly changed it back but now it shows that I changed it twice

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Should be interesting to see if he responds..

FML..

Tl;DR: gave my ex a (justifiably) crappy nickname on FB messenger, not realizing they would see it.
