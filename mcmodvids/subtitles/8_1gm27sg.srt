Content:
If you've ever used a phone by a Chinese company, you'll note they have a tendency to run like crap, filter your photos, and sell your data (so does Google) so naturally, I wanted to install a custom rom

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Sure, that's the first solution you think of

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It went so well

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Bootloader unlocked all at my own risk, and then I try to flash the rom

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Not enough space, after some research I found I could delete the "product" partition at my own risk

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Having not specified a or b, I thought nothing of it

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Half way through going to boot TWRP, it decides to reboot

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Having deleted userdata, adb debugging came pre-disabled

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It now continuously vibrates and reboots shaming me for killing it

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Its only input to the outside world is displaying "Redmi" over and over, and I have no way into it.

Â£200 mistake

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Not my worst work.

TL;DR buy a Google Pixel

Edit: no need to downvote everything, I know I'm an idiot that's why anyone posts here.

Edit again: Fastboot nope

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Recovery nope.

Also edit: Get it in your head, I cannot splurge on a phone all at once

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It has to be pay monthly or nothing

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Ergo debating dumbphone

Edit: Redmi Note 10 5G

Edit: MTK Client is the solution to all my problems

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Today I Un-f\*\*\*ed Up.
